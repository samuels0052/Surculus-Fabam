                        <h1>History and Evolution</h1>
                        <p class="history-text">November 7th, 2006; Africa is suffering; from famine and lack of food. However, in an article by Lauren Harris, she states,” Providing resources directly to farmers is one of the fastest ways to improve their conditions and crop yields, as well as the health and nutrition of their families and communities.”(Lauren Harris). Leading; to a new genetically modified pea plant, the Surculus Fabam, which has set foot in African soil. This pea was created for better tasting and more nutritious peas to solve hunger in Africa while being able to grow in African soil and be very abundant. However, it was deemed an invasive species when it took nutrients from other plants in the area through the roots while spreading itself by shooting the peas at herbivores that tried to eat it. Even though the scientists theorized that the pea would be tastier, instead of being tastier, the pea stored the carbon dioxide in the pea pod instead of the actual pea, and; the increased size of the pea from the genetically modified plant made it a great pea shooter. </p>
                        <p class="history-text">November 7th, 2010, the Surculus Fabam invaded northern Africa and overtook a quarter of the savannah. The pea managed to mutate during that time and produce more spiky peas. However because it is spikier, it developed a carbonated texture to that of sparkling water because of the carbon dioxide inside the pea pods. A group of scientists arrived at a group of pea plants that had mutated. They found out that all the peas in the group had ripe peas that were spiky and brown.  The scientists concluded that the reason behind this mutation was that the pea plant had to adapt to the animals of the savannah like rhinos and zebras who eat grass. Scientists took one back to the lab and studied the plant for over 5 years.</p>
                        <p class="history-text">November 7th 2015, it has been 9 years since the first outbreak of the pea. The biologists figured out that the pea detects movement by roots in the ground through echolocation. This was a mutation gained during the 5 years of mutations in the African soil. The plant also aims by tightening the stems of the plant to shoot the predator. They put the plant with a mouse in a glass cage together. As they watched the mouse they noticed, the moment the mouse set foot in the cage, the plant started tightening and aiming at the mouse. The plant then fired 4-5 of its pods and plummeted the mouse with peas. After observing, the biologists took the mouse out after 5 minutes and found out it had multiple wounds on its body.  They then studied the plant and the mouse and found out that the glass cage had a higher carbon dioxide concentration than anywhere else in the room. When the biologists went back to Africa, they studied the CO2 concentration around the plant. It read that the CO2 around the peas was greatly higher than the other parts. The biologists concluded that the CO2 was high because it is used as a fuel for shooting and for luring other plants to grow faster so it can steal their nutrients instead of making oxygen with it. Due to an increase of  carbon dioxide, the leaves around the plant thickened and we have yet to realize why it would do it. In a case study about global warming, it stated, “Leaves can thicken by as much as a third, which changes the ratio of surface area to mass in the leaf and alters plant activities like photosynthesis, gas exchange, evaporative cooling and sugar storage.”(James Urton). After losing hope in the pea, the plant biologists gave up on the pea plant and left it in Africa continuously growing forever.</p>

The plant also released large amounts of CO₂ frightening, the biologists. Researchers gave up on saving the species and left them alone in the Savannas, continuing to spread.</p>
