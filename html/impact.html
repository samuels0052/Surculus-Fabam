                    <h1>Impact on the Earth</h1>
                    <p class="impact-text">Peas are from the middle east, specifically in Iraq and turkey. Peas have many predators, such as slugs, deer, and lacewings. If peas gain the power to shoot at predators as a defense/ attack mechanismâ€¦ What would happen to all the poor predators?  Well, they would get attacked, and force them to leave the peas alone, but that's only for its larger predators. This would only affect deer, chipmunks, rabbits, etc. for insects and parasites; this would unphased them as they are too small and fast for the pea shoots to hit them. But, if the peas catch the insects like lacewings lacking they would die as it shoots like a gun going about 1700 mph. This will cause many animals that rely on peas to go for other prey, destroying the balance and, after their food is gone, they would die out from lack of food. Leading; to the destruction of the diversity of the ecosystem resulting in the death of many. This sudden change in the peas would cause the pea shooter to be an invasive species that greatly harm an ecosystem.</p>
                    <p class="impact-text">An invasive species is very dangerous to an ecosystem because of the imbalance in its chain of life. According to the article "invasive species", Approximately 42 percent of threatened or <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Understanding-Conservation/Endangered-Species.aspx" target="_blank">endangered species</a> are at risk due to invasive species." This is very concerning as the main cause of invasive species is humans. For instance, the Australian blackwood which was from Australia is a 7 to 10-meter tree that has value for trading and uses for firewood". You may think that; a tree has nothing to do with the ecosystem, it's just a tree. That may have been what others thought, but the cause of effect of this invasive species is that it competes with local vegetation communities by replacing grass and "reduces biodiversity and in addition increases lack of water in coastal areas '. Biodiversity is one of the main ways ecosystems survive and is one of the ways an ecosystem has balance in life and death of life in the ecosystem. If a tree can cause this much damage to an ecosystem imagine the damage the peashooter can do.</p>
