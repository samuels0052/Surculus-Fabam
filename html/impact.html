                    <h1>Impact on the Earth</h1>
                    <p class="impact-text">When the Surculus Fabam was created by scientists in the Middle East by modifying pea plants, in doing so it created a heavy impact on the savannahs in which it would reside. Over time, it would take over the Savannahs in Iraq and Turkey, and soon its invasiveness would take a toll on the rest of the world. Peas have many predators, preferring smaller animals like slugs, deer, and lacewings. If these peashooters gain the power to shoot at predators as a defense or attack mechanism, what would happen to their predators? They would be attacked by the peas, and be forced to leave the peas alone, but that's only for the larger predators. This would only affect deer, chipmunks, rabbits, etc.; for insects and parasites, this would unphased them as they are too small and fast for the pea shoots to hit them. But if the peas catch the insects like lacewings, they would die as it shoots like a gun at about 1700 mph. This will cause many animals that rely on peas to go for other prey, destroying the balance, and after their food is gone, they will die from lack of food. This can destroy the diversity of the ecosystem, resulting in the deaths of many. This sudden change in the peas would cause the pea shooter to be an invasive species that greatly harms an ecosystem.</p>
                    <p class="impact-text">This sudden change in the ecosystem the peashooter placed itself in would cause the peashooter to be an invasive species, one that greatly harms its ecosystem. For example, if the predators of the animals mentioned prior were to be outclassed by the peashooter (wolves, foxes, for example), they would be forced to migrate or die out in that environment because the peashooter had taken their primary source of food. As quoted by the California Wolf Center, "Wolves are what’s referred to as a "keystone species", which is any species that other plants and animals within an ecosystem largely depend on. If a keystone species is removed, the ecosystem would drastically change, and in some cases, collapse." If predators like wolves and foxes were to die out because they were overtaken by an invasive species, the food chain would crumble because animals lower in the food chain would overpopulate, eat their prey, and eventually die of starvation because they had eaten all of their living prey in that environment, creating a domino effect. You might ask, Why can’t the peashooter take the place of the foxes and wolves? They can’t because there is no predator (as far as we know) that can get close enough to eat a peashooter because of its extremely deadly, swift peas; any that try would be forced to flee unless it can withstand its peas with ease. Predators are also unable to sneak up on the peashooter because of how it detects movement with its roots. Truthfully, the only obstacles preventing the peashooter from global chain dominance are that it’s interested in only smaller animals and that it cannot thrive in the ocean.</p>
                    <p class="impact-text">Furthermore, an invasive species is very dangerous to an ecosystem because of the imbalance in its food chain. According to the article on invasive species," Approximately 42 percent of threatened or endangered species are at risk due to invasive species." This is very concerning, as the main cause of invasive species is humans. For instance, the Australian blackwood, which is from Australia, is a 7- to 10-meter tree that has value for trading and uses for firewood". You may think that a tree has nothing to do with the ecosystem; it's just a tree. That may have been what others thought, but the cause and effect of this invasive species is that it competes with local vegetation communities by replacing grass and "reduces biodiversity and, in addition, increases the lack of water in coastal areas '. Biodiversity is one of the main ways ecosystems survive and is one of the ways an ecosystem has balance in the life and death of life in the ecosystem. If a tree can cause this much damage to an ecosystem, imagine the damage a peashooter can do.</p>
